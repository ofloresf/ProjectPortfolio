This is the function to use if you don't want to add values one by one. To use the function, you first have to create a separate list of the values you want to add. Then, you will use the .extend() function to add all the values on the list onto the end of the existing list. See below for an example:\n","\n","    new_list = [\"new_value1\", \"new_value2\", \"new_value3\"...]\n","    list_name.extend( new_list )\n","    \n","    \n","    new_colors = [\"green-3\", \"purple-4\"]\n","    colors.extend(new_colors)\n","    \n","1. Create a list of shapes below. This list should have at least 3 values. Print the list.\n","2. Use the append function to add a shape to your list. Print the list.\n","3. Use the insert function to add a shape to your list. This shape should be inserted in index position 2. Print the list.\n","4. Use the extend function to add 3 additional shapes to your list. Print the list."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"bdba2f86","metadata":{"id":"bdba2f86","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712778009938,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":123,"user":{"displayName":"OSCAR FLORES","userId":"02823430249747028835"}},"outputId":"96304c93-1cd2-4442-854e-3c98f41e0ed5"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["['circle', 'triangle', 'hexagon', 'square', 'pentagon', 'septagon', 'octagon', 'nonagon']\n"]}],"source":["shapes = [\"circle\",\"triangle\",\"square\"]\n","shapes.append(\"pentagon\")\n","shapes.insert(2,\"hexagon\")\n","more_shapes = (\"septagon\",\"octagon\",\"nonagon\")\n","shapes.extend(more_shapes)\n","print(shapes)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3a61113f","metadata":{"id":"3a61113f"},"source":["# { Module 3 Quiz }\n","\n","1.
