Python Zip Code Data Cleaning Project
We will use the BP data cleaning files as a basis for cleaning another data set.

Download and open the Zip_Codes.txt file.  The Zip Codes must be delimited by a dash, or hyphen:  "-"

The Zip_Codes.txt file contains multiple delimiters:  
\
_
-
.
/
|
Modify your 1st BP cleaning Python file to replace the bad delimiters above with a hyphen, or "-". 

Modify your 2nd BP wrangling Python file to split the cleaned Zip Code data into two columns at the "-".

Save the cleaned data file as 'zip_code.csv'
