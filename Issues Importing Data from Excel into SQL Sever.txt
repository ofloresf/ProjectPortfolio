If you get an error message like this one:

TITLE: SQL Server Import and Export Wizard ------------------------------ The operation could not be completed. ------------------------------ ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The 'Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.16.0' provider is not registered on the local machine. (System.Data) ------------------------------ BUTTONS: OK ------------------------------

When trying to import data from Excel into SQL Server, download the following 32-bits file, then install it from the CMD Command Prompt in Windows (As an Administrator) with /quiet at the end [AccessDatabaseEngine.exe /quiet]. Once this is done you will import the data with no problem.
